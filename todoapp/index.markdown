## Thoughts

* I already enjoy TheHitList since they already have a [mac][thl-mac] and [ios][thl-ios] client, though the lack of updates and the lack of any api to work against leaves me sad.
* I like trying to use standards whenever possible because I want to avoid re-inventing the wheel but sometimes they're hard to work with
* [taskwarrior] looks interesting, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the complicated sync server. It would have been better to re-use something like caldav if possible
* Even using caldav, it's unclear how various clients handle metadata regarding `X-headers`


## Inspiration
* TheHitList - [ios][thl-ios] [macos][thl-mac]
* [taskwarrior] - *nix
