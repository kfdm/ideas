# Timers app

Combine various timers and pomodoro like apps in a single, simplified interface

## Inspiration

https://github.com/ugol/pomodoro

## Goals

### Scriptable

Should be easily scriptable so that tools like Alfred can take advantage of starting new timers

* "timer 5m Make some tea"
* "pomodoro Do some work"

### Handoff

Should be able to start a timer on my phone and get the alert on my mac

### Tagable

Should keep a log that is tagged with interesting metadata or user defined metadata

* "timer 5m Do some work #work"
* "timer 5m Do some studying #study"

Then interesting reports could be generated later

### Triggers

Should be able to trigger scripts on different events. Using a pomodoro example: start, stop, interrupt, resume, reset
