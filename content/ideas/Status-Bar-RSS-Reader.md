Something simple to replace [feedsapp] which seems mostly [unmaintained]

Would like to have something with basic feed support with [favicon]s to make it easier to identify feeds

[feedsapp]: https://github.com/nfarina/feeds
[unmaintained]: https://twitter.com/feedsapp
[favicon]: https://github.com/leonbreedt/FavIcon
