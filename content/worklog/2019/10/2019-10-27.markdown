# Activitypub

- Testing some code to see how easy it would be to add activitypub to my [django](https://github.com/kfdm/django-activitypub) application

  - Added a simple webfinger implementation
  - Added rest framework routes
  - May end up doing without rest-framework under an `/activitypub` route since it may be easier that way

# Quickstats

- Fixed the Location updating due to the AppConfig not being auto loaded
- Added a test subscription route, but need to think through the flow a bit better
