Jekyll is a fairly powerful platform for blogging, and I think a few scripts built around it could also be useful for maintaining a worklog

## Inspiration

### Agenda

[Agenda](https://agenda.com/) seems to be very nicely done, but I want a bit more control over mapping to calendars

### jrnl

[jrnl](http://jrnl.sh/) is nice for the simplicitiy but I want a bit more structure than everything in a single file

### vscode-journal

[vscode-journal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pajoma.vscode-journal) is a neat way of organizing things
