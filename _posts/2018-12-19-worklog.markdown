Jekyll is a fairly powerful platform for blogging, and I think a few scripts built around it could also be useful for maintaining a worklog

## Inspiration

### Agenda

[Agenda] seems to be very nicely done, but I want a bit more control over mapping to calendars

### jrnl

[jrnl] is nice for the simplicitiy but I want a bit more structure than everything in a single file

### vscode-journal

[vscode-journal] is a neat way of organizing things

### trilium

[trilium] looks interesting, though instead of sqlite I think I want to use flat files. Metadata could be stored in frontmatter
